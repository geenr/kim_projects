this project is on creating an airbnb clone
we begin with the console - here we shall use the cmd modelu which helps display a prompt
and also make our own commands which must start with the word do eg def do_print
cmd has an inbuilt loop which helps to keep the loop going this method is known as the cmdloop()
this project shall focus on the following 
console(its like the simpleshell project but now we are using the python language)
file storage - where we shall store the python objects in the JSON format so that the file can be used
by other programs even if a different language is being used eg javascript failure to which the files cant be reused
the conversion of an object file to a JSON is what is known as serialisation
assigning a unique UID - we shall use the uuid.uuid4()
updating the time - here we shall use datetime module which we must import
the BaseModel file will conntain the classes which are basic and must be used by all files
for every folder there must be a __init__.py file
in my cmd you can type help which lists down all available commands in the console
